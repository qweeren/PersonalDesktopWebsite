This is a web app that recreates the look and feel of the Windows XP operating system. You can interact with the desktop, open and close windows, play Minesweeper, and more. This website is built with Svelte and Vite, and deployed on Vercel.
I built this out of boredom and it was fun to make. I had little unrelated projects laying around and thought why not put them all in one website. This is the idea i came up with. You can try these projects under the "Random Projects" folder on the desktop.
The current way to add your own apps is really really bad and not modular at all. Because i couldn't find a way to inject a .svelte component into the DOM. If you find a better way please submit a pull request.
